# CodingQuiz

## Description

As a coding bootcamp student, my motivation to create this app was to test my skills at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Creating this quiz also lets me test the skills of the users that will come to the site and take the quiz.
It helped me to study as well by looking up questions to put into the quiz and needing to know the correct answers myself.

I built an app that will work towards completing this user story:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
